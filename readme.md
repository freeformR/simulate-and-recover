This simulation study investigated the EZ diffusion model’s ability to recover its own parameters—drift rate (ν), boundary separation (a), and non-decision time (τ)—across sample sizes of N = 10, 40, and 4,000 trials. Utilizing both analytical equations and numerical optimization (to better tweak our initial guess and more accurately land on our true values), this simulation study successfully simulated and recovered its own parameters.

Across three sample sizes of N = 10, 40, and 4000 trials, the EZ diffusion model I drafted with support from Microsoft’s Copilot demonstrated its ability to accurately simulate and recover its own parameters. However, the level of bias and mean squared error (MSE) varied not only across parameters but also across sample sizes. Comparing each parameter, boundary separation (a), drift rate (ν), and non-decision time (τ) in terms of bias, which in this case is the average amount of deviation of the estimates from the true values, we can see a clear pattern. In a sample size of N = 10 compared to both boundary separation (-0.016) and non-decision time (-0.002), the drift rate demonstrated the highest level of bias in our model (-0.053). This pattern continued onto a sample size of N = 40, where the drift rate had a bias of -0.012 compared to -0.004 for boundary separation and -0.002 for non-decision time. Similarly In terms of the mean squared error drift rate, it demonstrated a higher level of sensitivity, with its mean squared error consistently higher than the other parameters. Concerning sample sizes, the model demonstrated how parameter recovery drastically improves in both bias and MSE with larger sample sizes. Drift rate, Boundary separation, and non-decision time all benefited from higher sample sizes; however, the degree of improvement varied across parameters as discussed above. Especially important is how, for large sample sizes (N = 4,000), estimates become nearly unbiased (0.0002) with very little error (0.001). With this in mind, it’s clear that drift rate was the most sensitive to sample size, which is likely due to its exponential relationship with accuracy in the EZ equations. In comparison, boundary separation demonstrated moderate sensitivity to sample size, while non-decision time remained relatively robust even at small sample sizes like N = 10 (MSE = 0.011).


All of these patterns align with the core structure of the EZ model. Non-decision time (τ) operates additively in its relationship to reaction times, making it inherently more stable against sampling fluctuations. In contrast, drift rate (ν) and boundary separation (a) involve multiplication within the model’s equations, amplifying their sensitivity to smaller sample sizes.

From a practical standpoint, these results showcase the critical role of sample size in experimental design. While N = 40 may be adequate for preliminary investigations of boundary separation and non-decision time, reliably estimating drift rate demands N ≥ 4,000. The consistent negative bias observed for ν at smaller N further cautions against drawing strong conclusions about drift rate differences in studies with limited data. This, of course, is quite well known, as larger sample sizes are almost always preferred in studies for their robustness in statistical inference.
